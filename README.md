Hi, Nice to meet you.
I'm a bit of a digital product junky. Over the years, I've used hundreds of web and mobile apps. Eventually, I decided that it would be a fun challenge to try designing and building my own. You can find me on [![Twitter][1.2]][1].

## &#x270d; Blog & Writing

Apart from coding, I also maintain a blog - you can find my writings on my website at [QuilWrites](https://quillwrites.wordpress.com/). as well as on [Team CodeHub](https://teamcodehub.github.io/CodeHub.github.io/).
